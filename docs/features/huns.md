## Historical Context

The Huns were a nomadic people who lived in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia between the 1st and 7th centuries AD. Under the leadership of Attila the Hun in the 5th century, they became one of the most feared barbarian tribes in Europe, launching devastating raids and conquests that contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Known for their exceptional horsemanship and archery skills, the Huns were masters of mobile warfare and hit-and-run tactics that terrorized settled civilizations across Europe and Asia.
