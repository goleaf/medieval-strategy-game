## Historical Context

The Vikings were Norse seafarers from Scandinavia who raided and traded from their homelands across wide areas of Europe from the late 8th to 11th centuries. Known for their shipbuilding skills and warrior culture, they established settlements and trading posts throughout Europe, Asia, and even North America. Their longships were technologically advanced vessels that allowed them to travel great distances and launch surprise attacks.
