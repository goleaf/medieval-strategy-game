# Teutons Tribe

## Overview

The **Teutons** are the most aggressive and fearless of all tribes. Their warriors are infamous for their **rage in battle** and relentless **pillage raids**. Unafraid of death, they roam the lands in overwhelming numbers, striking fear into their enemies.

While Teutonic troops lack the discipline and organization of the **Romans** and **Gauls**, they make up for it with sheer **ferocity and numbers**. Their units are **cheap to train**, **fast to produce**, and have **excellent carrying capacity**, making them ideal for **early-game raiding** and **constant aggression**.

> The Teutons are a great choice for **offense-minded and experienced players** who enjoy fast-paced, high-pressure gameplay focused on raiding and domination.

## Playstyle Tips

* Focus on **raiding early and often** — your troops are cheap, expendable, and perfect for resource theft.
* Use your **Brewery** to increase your attack power when planning major assaults.
* Your **Earth Wall** is hard to destroy but offers limited defense — rely on offense, not fortifications.
* Keep your hero active in raids to benefit from the **Cranny dip bonus**.

## Historical Context

The Teutons were a Germanic tribe that played a significant role in the Migration Period and the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Known for their fierce warriors and relentless raiding tactics, they were among the most formidable barbarian tribes that challenged Roman authority in Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries AD. Their reputation for ferocity and their ability to field large numbers of warriors made them a constant threat to settled civilizations, embodying the aggressive, raiding-focused playstyle that defines them in strategy games.
