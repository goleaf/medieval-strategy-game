## Historical Context

The ancient Egyptians were one of the most advanced civilizations of the ancient world, known for their monumental architecture including the pyramids and Sphinx, their sophisticated irrigation systems along the Nile River, and their complex society with pharaohs, priests, and administrators. Their economy was based on agriculture made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile, and they developed writing, mathematics, and engineering that influenced subsequent civilizations. The Egyptians were masters of defensive warfare, using the natural barriers of deserts and the Nile to protect their territory, while their administrative systems ensured efficient resource management and distribution.
