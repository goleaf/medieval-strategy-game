# Core Building Audit Checklist

Print or export this condensed sheet to confirm every core building when speccing or auditing a world. Mark boxes digitally or on paper to document readiness per village, world rule, or ops review.

## Quick Reference Snapshot

| Building | Purpose | Availability | Prerequisites | Key Levels | Synergy Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Headquarters (HQ) | Master build queue; each upgrade shortens all build times. | Always available; every village begins at level 1. | None. | Level 15 unlocks Demolition (village loyalty must be 100%). | Faster HQ = faster economy/military ramps; Demolition recovers Farm population for re-specialization. |
| Barracks | Trains infantry (Spearmen, Swordsmen, Archers if enabled). | Always on. | None; Wall construction requires Barracks 1. | Higher levels shrink infantry recruitment timers. | Coordinate with Wall for early defense; throughput is bottleneck for stacked support queues. |
| Stable | Trains cavalry (Scouts, LC, HC, Mounted Archers if enabled). | Always on. | Typically Barracks 5 + Smithy 5 (verify world config). | Simple tech: Stable 10 + Smithy 15 for Heavy Cavalry. | Pace Stable upgrades with Smithy research; anchors fast offensive villages and scout coverage. |
| Workshop | Produces siege engines (Rams, Catapults). | Always on. | Usually HQ 10, Barracks 10, Stable 5 (world-tuned). | Higher levels cut siege recruitment time. | Land Rams in clear waves before Nobles; Catapults finish buildings after combat resolution. |
| Smithy | Research hub unlocking units & upgrades. | Always on. | HQ 5 baseline. | Higher levels unlock advanced units and reduce research time. | Required for Stable/Workshop unlocks and Academy; tech model (Simple / 3-level / 10-level) is world specific. |
| Market | Enables player trades and transports; adds merchants per level. | Always on. | Commonly Warehouse 2 + HQ 3 (confirm ruleset). | Level 10 mandatory for Academy on coin worlds. | Watch Warehouse caps to avoid overflow; critical for tribe resource funnels. |
| Academy | Trains Noblemen for conquests (loyalty reduction). | Unlock once prereqs met; max level 1 (coin) or 3 (package). | HQ 20, Smithy 20, Market 10. | Coin worlds mint coins globally; package worlds upgrade Academy for noble slots. | Noble speed/loyalty drop vary per world; sync with ram waves and offensive trains. |
| Rally Point | Sends attacks, supports, and scouts; manages troop movements. | Always active at level 1. | HQ 1 placement. | Functional single level (UI upgrades only via mods/scripts). | Central for timing plays (backtimes, snipes, trains); ensure hotkeys comply with server rules. |
| Statue | Recruits & manages Paladins plus skill training. | Always on. | HQ 5 (typical). | Single level; Paladin recruitment needs available slot. | Training must start in Statue village; Paladin dies if village is nobled mid-training. |
| Wall | Multiplies defensive strength of stationed troops. | Always on. | Barracks 1. | Each level dramatically boosts defense multiplier. | Rams reduce effective Wall level during attacks; rebuild between waves and pair with Hiding Place to blunt farms. |
| Watchtower* | Tags incoming attacks that enter its radius; shows size bands/noble icon. | Only when Watchtowers enabled. | HQ 5 (typical) plus Farm population budget. | Higher levels expand detection radius; placement dictates coverage. | Space multiple Watchtowers for border coverage without starving troop population. |
| Church / First Church* | Keeps villages within influence at 100% strength; outside fights at 50%. | Only on Church-enabled worlds. | First Church auto-builds; additional Churches need HQ 5 + Market 1 (verify world). | Church upgrades (1–3) extend influence; First Church is fixed. | Plan leapfrog coverage around offense hubs; competes with Watchtower/Farm population budgets. |
| Timber Camp | Produces wood income. | Always on. | HQ 1. | Every level raises hourly wood output (speed & production factor apply). | Wood heavy for offensive builds (axes, LC); balance vs clay/iron plan. |
| Clay Pit | Generates clay income. | Always on. | HQ 1. | Every level raises hourly clay output. | Defensive troops/buildings skew clay heavy; track alongside Wall/Farm upgrades. |
| Iron Mine | Generates iron income. | Always on. | HQ 1. | Every level raises hourly iron output. | Cavalry & siege are iron intensive; sync with Stable/Workshop queues. |
| Farm | Sets population cap supporting buildings & troops. | Always on. | HQ 1. | Higher levels expand population capacity; damage can stall new queues. | Monitor population before nobles/siege; weigh Farm vs Watchtower/Church population usage. |
| Warehouse | Stores resources; caps production. | Always on. | HQ 1. | Each level lifts storage limit; overflow halts production. | Align Market shipments and income spikes to avoid waste. |
| Hiding Place | Shields a fixed stash from plunder & scout reports. | Always on. | HQ 1. | Each level increases protected stash. | Pair with Wall for anti-farm setups; still affects barbarian farming cadence on no-haul worlds. |

\*World toggle structures consume Farm space—budget them alongside troop caps.
