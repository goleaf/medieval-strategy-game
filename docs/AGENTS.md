# Documentation Guidelines

- Keep documentation in Markdown with clear heading hierarchy starting at `#` for page titles.
- When adding reference material, update `docs/README.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` so the table of contents and history stay accurate.
- Prefer tables for checklists or templates that players or admins will print; include short context paragraphs before each table.
- Cite official Tribal Wars support links when mirroring mechanics from the live game.
- Avoid duplicating data across files—cross-link instead.
- When gameplay numbers vary by tribe or building level, cross-check the latest implementation (e.g., merchant capacity helpers) before publishing values.
